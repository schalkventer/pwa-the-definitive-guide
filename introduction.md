# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## Motivation

I was super excited when I first heard about the \(then up-and-coming\) suite of technologies that allow web developers to create projects/products that are able to compete directly with native mobile and desktop software.

It started at one of the monthly [Cape Town Front-end Developers](https://ctfeds.org/) meetups, titled [_Service Workers and Push Notifications_](https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/225531712/)_,_ in 2015_._ I also have embarrassing memories of it coming to light that I assumed the title referred to employees working tech-support \(I.e. "service worker"\) and how they and developers use push notifications on their platform.

I left that meetup incredibly energized about the possibilities, which lead to me consuming every single piece of literature on Progressive Web Apps. I went all the way from the very early documentation on [the Google Developers website](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps), to the phenomenal [Mozilla Service Worker Cookbook](https://serviceworke.rs/), and Tal Ater's phenomenal[ Building Progressive Web Apps: Bringing the Power of Native to the Browser](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052067.do) during the next 4 years.

Fast-forward to 2019, and in an ironic twist of fate I'm now one of the co-organizers of those very same monthly meetups. Certainly, I would get as mention speakers/facilitators to do talks/workshops on this topic? Unfortunately not. After several attempts it just didn't seem that most front-end developers felt comfortable talking about _Progressive Web Apps_. Most of them had a good grasp on some aspects individual aspect of the co-configuration of technologies that gave us the _Progressive Web App_. However, most felt that they weren't qualified to guide other developers interested in starting \(or converting an existing\) project into a Progressive Web App.

In response to this I started compiling a list of helpful links about _Progressive Web Apps_ and all associated technology at the end of 2018. My hope was that if someone where to do a talk on the subject they would have a bit of a head-start, and might feel a bit more confident. After some time I started adding my own notes and examples to the document. It didn't take long for my own notes/examples to actually overtake the amount of external content/links I included.

This must have worked, since I was finally able to coerce a good friend of mine, [Shailen Naidoo](https://github.com/ShailenNaidoo), to co-facilitate a whole day workshop on Progressive Web Apps. However, it seemed like a bit of a waste to discard all the information I gathered over this time. This lead me to this open-source guide, which is an attempt to cover everything required to go from zero to a fully-featured, modern _Progressive Web Apps_.
