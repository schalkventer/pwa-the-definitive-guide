# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## Motivation

Like most web developers, I started out extremely excited when I first heard about the \(then up-and-coming\) suite of technologies that allow web developers to create projects/products, that are able to compete directly with native mobile and desktop software.

It started at one of the monthly [Cape Town Front-end Developers](https://ctfeds.org/) meetups titled [_Service Workers and Push Notifications_](https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/225531712/)_._ I also vividly remember assuming that service workers \(much to my embarrassment\) referred to employees working tech-support, and therefore the talk will cover how they and/or their platform use push notifications in their daily work.

I left that meetup breathing in every single piece of literature on Progressive Web Apps, from the very early documentation on [the Google Developers website](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps), to the phenomenal [Mozilla Service Worker Cookbook](https://serviceworke.rs/), during the next 3 years.

Fast-forward to 2019, and I'm now one of the co-hosts of that monthly meetup. Not only that, but we haven't had another talk/workshop on Progressive Web Apps since. I assure you this is not from a lack of trying! I just didn't seem like anyone felt that they knew enough about Progressive Web Apps, to do a talk/workshop. Most attendees seemed to know a bit here and there about aspects of Progressive Web Apps, but only out of necessity when requested by clients/teams. In response to this I started compiling a list of helpful links about Progressive Web Apps and all associated technology, in the hopes that if someone where to do a talk on the subject matter they would have a bit of a head-start. I eventually started adding my own notes and examples, and at some point the personal notes/examples made up the majority of the document.

I was finally able to coerce a good friend of mine, [Shailen Naidoo](https://github.com/ShailenNaidoo), to co-facilitate a whole day workshop on Progressive Web Apps in early 2020.T This meant that the collection of notes finally served it's purpose. However, due to the sheer size of it I thought it might actually be of value to further refine and publish it as an open-source project for anyone who anyone interested in building their first Progressive Web App.
