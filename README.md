# PWA: The Definitive Guide

## Overview

A comprehensive, yet beginner-friendly, guide to building fully-featured _Progressive Web Apps_ capable of directly competing with native mobile and desktop apps in 2019.

All that is required to start \(and complete\) this guide is:

* **A couple of HTML \(`.html`\) files.**
* **A couple of JavaScript \(`.js`\) files.**
* **A text editor to edit them.**
* **A web browser to view them.**

That's it!

We won't be using any front-end or back-end libraries, frameworks, external tools and build processes. If you know some HTML and a bit of JavaScript you should be able jump in anywhere by browsing the [Table of Contents](./#table-of-contents) or [Summary ](./#summary)sections below. Alternatively, you can also take it slow and work through this guide section per section all the way from the top.
