# 🤷‍♀️ Pros and Cons

### Overview

### Background

I remember the first native app I worked on.

This was early 2014, and every client and their niece wanted to have some form of mobile app for their product \(whether justified or not\). The excitement around mobile apps were still at an all time high. In fact, just 4 years prior the [American Dialect Society](https://www.americandialect.org/) named the word 'App' as their 2010 word of the year, citing that:

> “App has been around for ages, but with millions of dollars of marketing muscle behind the slogan ‘There’s an app for that,’ plus the arrival of ‘app stores’ for a wide spectrum of operating systems for phones and computers, app really exploded in the last 12 months,” Zimmer said. “One of the most convincing arguments from the voting floor was from a woman who said that even her grandmother had heard of it.”

The agency that I worked for at that time was approached by an organisation hosting an international week-long conference in Cape Town. Our team had done almost no mobile app work around this time and the team lead thought it might be a good opportunity to cut our teeth on an easy project. 

At this time [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) was widely used, and due to our team's familiarity with the web, this is what we decided on. Given that I rarely ventured outside the confines of Cordova, the process was indistinguishable from designing a regular JavaScript-based web project. Unfortunately I could not say the same for the team lead. I'm sure he racked up quite a bill judging by daily phone conversation from Cape Town, South Africa to California, USA. The deadline was quite tight and the team was scurrying to push the product past the gatekeepers at the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store) in time. We ended up barely scraping past the deadline, however we were extremely proud. The client was extremely impressed, and I remember us having a celebratory party at the office soon afterwards.

The first day of the conference we kept our eyes firmly fixed on the amount of downloads, expecting an affirmation of the hard work that we put in. Unfortunately late-afternoon the numbers were still frighteningly low. We just assumed that they forgot to promote it at the conference. After quick call with the organisation assured us that they had erected banners and distributed various merchandise with the URL on. We figured that the amount of downloads displayed on the various platforms were cached and would update in a couple of hours or days.

A month later the amount barely changed. To this day the project is one of the biggest failure's I've experienced in my career. As far as I know no-one \(myself included\) has worked on an native applications since.

### PWA vs. Native Application

I've often wondered whether things might have turned out differently if we had the option of building a _Progressive Web App_ back then.
