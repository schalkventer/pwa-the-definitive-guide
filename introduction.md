# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## Motivation for this guide

Like most web developers, I started out extremely excited when I first heard about the \(then up-and-coming\) suite of technologies that allow web developers to build products, that are able to compete directly with native mobile and desktop software.

**The best part?   
It can be done with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
I.e. no libraries, frameworks or conversion tools required.**

It started one of the monthly [Cape Town Front-end Developers](https://ctfeds.org/) meetups titled [_Service Workers and Push Notifications_](https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/225531712/)_._ I also remember thinking that service workers \(much to my embarrassment\) referred to "tech support" employees, and therefore how they could use push notifications to engage with users.

During my 2 years as co-host of the very same meetup  I slowly came to realize the following:

* **A lot of individual developers are interested in learning how to build Progressive Web Apps.**
* **Their teams and clients are looking into less costly ways to maintain their cross-platform apps.**
* **However, there seems to be very few beginner-friendly resources that cover the entire scope of building/maintaining Progressive Web Apps in 2019.**

More often than not I referred people to a list of resources from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) to [Google](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps). However, these either assumed a basic familiarity with creating a PWA or only focused on selected aspects. As this resource grew I started adding a couple of my own notes and examples. Initially this resource meant merely accompanied a series of workshops that I've done on building Progressive Web Apps. However due to the positive response I got from it I thought it might be valuable to publish it online and open-source it to the wider web development community.

My hope is that this resources eventually contains everything needed to go from zero to a fully-featured PWA capable of directly competing with native mobile apps.
