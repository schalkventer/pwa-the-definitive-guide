# 👋 Introduction

## Motivation for this guide

During my time co-hosting monthly [Cape Town Front-end Developers](https://ctfeds.org/) events over the past 2 years I slowly came to realize the following:

* **A lot of individual developers are interested in learning how to build Progressive Web Apps.**
* **Their teams and clients are looking into less costly ways to maintain their cross-platform apps.**
* **However, there seems to be very few beginner-friendly resources that cover the entire scope of building/maintaining Progressive Web Apps in 2019.**

More often than not I referred people to a list of resources from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) to [Google](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps). However, these either assumed a basic familiarity with creating a PWA or only focused on selected aspects. As this resource grew I started adding a couple of my own notes and examples. Initially this resource meant merely accompanied a series of workshops that I've done on building Progressive Web Apps. However due to the positive response I got from it I thought it might be valuable to publish it online and open-source it to the wider web development community.

My hope is that this resources eventually contains everything needed to go from zero to a fully-featured PWA capable of directly competing with native mobile apps.
