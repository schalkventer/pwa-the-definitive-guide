### Why consider a PWA?

I remember the first native app I worked on.

This was early 2014, and every client wanted to have some form of mobile app for their product \(whether justified or not\). The excitement around mobile apps were still at an all time high. In fact, just 4 years prior the [American Dialect Society](https://www.americandialect.org/) named the word 'App' as their 2010 word of the year, citing that:

> “App has been around for ages, but with millions of dollars of marketing muscle behind the slogan ‘There’s an app for that,’ plus the arrival of ‘app stores’ for a wide spectrum of operating systems for phones and computers, app really exploded in the last 12 months,” Zimmer said. “One of the most convincing arguments from the voting floor was from a woman who said that even her grandmother had heard of it.”

I was part of a bigger team that worked on the project, and mostly focused on the user-interface. However, this experience is burnt into my mind for two reasons:

* This was my \(and our team's\) first foray into the growing world of mobile apps.
* My relief that I was not the lead on this project.

I'm sure we racked up quite a bill with our nearly daily phone conversation all the way from Cape Town, South Africa to California, USA. The deadline was quite tight and we were scurrying to push the product through the gatekeepers at Apple. We ended up just meeting the deadline, and ended up having a post-launch celebration party.

The app has been out for a couple of days now and the number of downloads were not really reflecting as much. However, we figured that it might take a couple more days to start picking up.
