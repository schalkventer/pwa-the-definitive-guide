# 🤷‍♀️ Pros and Cons

## Overview

## Background

I remember the first time I worked on a native app.

This was early 2014, and every client wanted to have some form of mobile app for their product \(whether justified or not\). The excitement around mobile apps were still at an all time high. In fact, just 4 years prior the [American Dialect Society](https://www.americandialect.org/) named the word 'App' as their 2010 word of the year, citing that:

> “App has been around for ages, but with millions of dollars of marketing muscle behind the slogan ‘There’s an app for that,’ plus the arrival of ‘app stores’ for a wide spectrum of operating systems for phones and computers, app really exploded in the last 12 months,” Zimmer said. “One of the most convincing arguments from the voting floor was from a woman who said that even her grandmother had heard of it.”

The agency that I worked for at that time was approached by an organisation hosting an international, week-long conference in Cape Town. Our team had done little-to-none mobile app work at this time, however, the team lead thought it might be a good opportunity to cut our teeth on an easy project. 

At this time [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) was widely used and, due to our team's familiarity with building websites, this is what was decided on. Given that I rarely ventured outside the confines of Cordova, the process was indistinguishable from designing a regular JavaScript-heavy web project. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the team lead. I'm sure he racked up quite a phone bill by means of daily phone conversation from Cape Town, South Africa to California, USA. The deadline was quite tight and the team was scurrying to push the product past the gatekeepers at the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store) in time. 

In the end we ended up barely scraping past. Regardless, we were extremely proud and the client was extremely impressed with the end product. We even had a celebratory party at the office one evening. The first day of the conference we kept our eyes firmly fixed on the download ticker, expecting a positive feedback for the hard work we put in. Unfortunately, by late-afternoon the numbers were still frighteningly low. We assumed the organizers forgot to promote it on the first day already. However, after a quick call we were assured that they had erected banners and distributed various merchandise with the URL on during the day. Perhaps the amounts displayed by the various stores  were cached and would update in a couple of hours or days. Unfortunately, more than a month later the downloads barely changed. 

To this day the project remains one of the biggest failure's I've experienced in my career. 

Noted this might not be the common experience of most teams or clients. It is also possible that should we have attempted this in 2019 it might have fared better. However, I've often wondered whether things might have turned out differently if building a _Progressive Web App_ was an option back in 2014. 

Even if it failed to the same disastrously degree, we would \(at the very least\) not have pay the upfront Google Play store \($25 once-off\) and App Store \($99/year\) registration fees.

## The State of Native Apps

### What we know

According to Tal Ater \(in his phenomenal book, [Building Progressive Web Apps](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052067.do)\) it is certainly possible that this experience might not have been some professional fluke, but perhaps a more common occurrence:

> According to a 2016 comScore report, the average person spends 84% of his time on mobile devices using just the top 5 most popular apps. I’m sorry to say, these are not your apps.
>
> On tablets that number is even higher, with 95% of user time spent in the top 5 apps. The same report also presents figures showing that it is much easier to reach a large audience on a mobile site than in a native app. There are close to 600 mobile web properties that reach audiences larger than 5 million visitors — nearly 4.5 times greater than the number of native apps with similar audiences. The top 1,000 mobile web properties have audiences that are almost 3 times the size of the top 1,000, apps and their audiences are growing twice as fast as native app audiences.

The primary source seems to highlight this fact on several occasions:

> More time is being spent on smartphone apps, but most of that time is concentrated in the highest engagement apps owned by a few of the largest internet companies. The smartphone app now accounts for half of digital media time spent and is still growing strongly, but not at the rate it once was. And large internet companies command the majority of app time, so it can be a challenging market for lesser-known brands.

That being said, a lot has happened over the last 3 years since the above study. One being the rise of the behemoth that is the Chinese gaming market. In the words of American based mobile app analytics organisation, [App Annie](www.appannie.com):

> China accounted for nearly 40% of total consumer spend in 2018. Globally, on a category level, games accounted for 74% of consumer spend in 2018. Non-gaming apps only accounted for 26% of consumer spend, but this was up from 18% in 2016 and largely due to the growth of in-app subscriptions

It seems that this might correlate Ater's claim. However, with a slight shift in recent years towards gaming and subscription-based services like Netflix and Spotify.

### What we don't know.

Despite the above mentions, you will notice that I'm extremely weary to make any absolute claims about the state of native apps. I'm certainly not qualified to have much clout when it comes to analyzing global trends and interpreting these massive datasets, and subsequently you should not consider the above anything more than a cursory read. I'm convinced that a case for the opposite can just as easily be made.

In addition, contrary to most _Progressive Web App_ advocates, I'll be the first to say that some products should not be built as Progressive Web Apps.
